False News Detection through Sentiment Analysis

The Press Information Bureau (PIB) is the nodal agency of the Government of India to disseminate information on government policies, programs, initiatives, and achievements to the print and electronic media. It functions as an interface between the Government and the media and provides feedback to the Government on peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reactions as reflected in the media. Information is disseminated from Hqrs through Press Releases in English, Hindi, and Urdu and subsequently translated from PIB Regional offices into other Indian languages like Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Odia, Bengali, Assamese, and Manipuri, to reach out to about 8,400 newspapers and media organizations across the country. To provide effective and timely feedback to the Government, an automated feedback system for all the above regional languages using Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning is required. The feedback system should crawl the select regional media sites (around 200 websites).
